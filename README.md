> A modern, intuitive dashboard designed originally for Goethe Gymnasium Lichterfelde (GGL) to transform the lobby information display into a comprehensive school information hub.

## üìñ Overview

The School Dashboard was created to replace the outdated and clumsy substitution plan display in the lobby of Goethe Gymnasium Lichterfelde. Built with React and Spring Boot, it provides a centralized hub for students, teachers, and staff to access critical updates throughout the school day with a clean, responsive design.

While developed specifically for GGL, this application is designed to be adaptable for any school using the DSBmobile system for substitution plans.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Frontend

- React 19 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for fast development and build process

### Backend

- Spring Boot 2.7 Java backend
- RESTful API design
- Caching for performance optimization

## üß∞ API Integration Challenges

The integration with DSBmobile API was a significant challenge in this project. We initially attempted implementation using various Python libraries, which resulted in:

- 8+ hours of troubleshooting authentication issues
- Inconsistent data payloads
- Undocumented API changes

After these frustrations, we discovered and implemented a 6-year-old Java library that perfectly handles the DSBmobile integration. This discovery was a breakthrough moment for our project, enabling us to finally move forward with the core functionality.

> üí° **Lesson Learned**: Sometimes the best solution isn't the newest one. The robust Java implementation from 2018 outperformed modern alternatives.

### üò§ The DSBmobile Struggle

Working with DSBmobile has been an exercise in frustration due to heinekingmedia's approach to their platform:

- **No Public API**: Despite being used by thousands of schools, there's no official, documented API for developers
- **Zero Transparency**: Changes to the backend occur without warning, breaking third-party integrations
- **Artificial Barriers**: Simple data that should be easily accessible is obscured behind proprietary interfaces

This opacity has forced us to rely on reverse-engineered solutions, creating unnecessary technical debt and development delays for what should be a straightforward integration.

## üöÄ Getting Started

## Development

### Prerequisites

- JDK 11
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Maven

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zzacklack/school-dashboard.git
   cd school-dashboard
   ```

2. **Set up the backend**

   ```bash
   cd Backend
   # Update application.properties with your DSBmobile credentials
   mvn clean package
   # Replace X.Y.Z with the current version number
   java -jar target/school-dashboard-backend-X.Y.Z.jar
   ```

3. **Set up the frontend**

   ```bash
   cd ../Frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: <http://localhost:5173>
   - Backend API: <http://localhost:8080>

## Production

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Configuration

1. **Configure the Backend**:

- Set the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable to `prod` in your `docker-compose.yaml` file.
- Ensure all necessary environment variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys) are properly configured for the production environment.

2. **Configure the Frontend**:

- Ensure the frontend is configured to point to the correct backend URL. In the Dockerfile, the `sed` command replaces `http://localhost:8080` with `/api`. This assumes that your Nginx configuration correctly proxies `/api` requests to the backend service.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Build the Docker Images**:

  ```bash
  docker-compose build
  ```

2. **Run the Application with Docker Compose**:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

  This command builds the images and starts the containers in detached mode.

### Verification

1. **Check Container Status**:

  ```bash
  docker-compose ps
  ```

  Verify that both the frontend and backend containers are running without issues.

2. **Access the Application**:

  Open your browser and navigate to the domain or IP address where your application is deployed.

### HTTPS Configuration (Optional)

If you need HTTPS, you can configure Traefik (or another reverse proxy) to handle SSL termination. Here‚Äôs an example using Traefik labels in your `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
frontend:
  # ... other configurations ...
  labels:
  - "traefik.enable=true"
  - "traefik.http.routers.school-dashboard-secure.rule=Host(`your-domain.com`)"
  - "traefik.http.routers.school-dashboard-secure.entrypoints=https"
  - "traefik.http.routers.school-dashboard-secure.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
```

Make sure Traefik is properly configured to use Let's Encrypt for SSL certificate generation.

## üìù Development Status

This project is currently under active development. The core functionality is implemented, but we're working on:

- Design refinements and UI/UX improvements
- Additional feature implementations
- Performance optimizations
- Comprehensive testing

## üí° Why We Built This

The existing solution for displaying the substitution plan at GGL was:

- Visually outdated and difficult to read
- Limited to showing only substitution information
- Not responsive or adaptable to different screen sizes
- Unable to display other important information for students and staff

Our dashboard solves these problems by providing a modern, readable interface that combines substitution plans with weather, transportation, and other useful information in one unified display.

## üîÑ Development Roadmap

| Phase | Focus | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Core API Integration & Basic UI | ‚úÖ Done |
| 2 | Enhanced UI & Additional Features | üîÑ In Progress |
| 3 | Testing & Performance Optimization | üîÑ In Progress |
| 4 | Deployment & Documentation | üß© Partially done |
| 5 | User Feedback & Iteration | üîú Planned |
| 6 | Final Review & Launch | üîú Planned |
