> A modern, intuitive dashboard designed originally for Goethe Gymnasium Lichterfelde (GGL) to transform the lobby information display into a comprehensive school information hub.

## 📖 Overview

The School Dashboard was created to replace the outdated and clumsy substitution plan display in the lobby of Goethe Gymnasium Lichterfelde. Built with React and Spring Boot, it provides a centralized hub for students, teachers, and staff to access critical updates throughout the school day with a clean, responsive design.

While developed specifically for GGL, this application is designed to be adaptable for any school using the DSBmobile system for substitution plans.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Frontend

- React 19 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for fast development and build process

### Backend

- Spring Boot 2.7 Java backend
- RESTful API design
- Caching for performance optimization

## 🧰 API Integration Challenges

The integration with DSBmobile API was a significant challenge in this project. We initially attempted implementation using various Python libraries, which resulted in:

- 8+ hours of troubleshooting authentication issues
- Inconsistent data payloads
- Undocumented API changes

After these frustrations, we discovered and implemented a 6-year-old Java library that perfectly handles the DSBmobile integration. This discovery was a breakthrough moment for our project, enabling us to finally move forward with the core functionality.

> 💡 **Lesson Learned**: Sometimes the best solution isn't the newest one. The robust Java implementation from 2018 outperformed modern alternatives.

### 😤 The DSBmobile Struggle

Working with DSBmobile has been an exercise in frustration due to heinekingmedia's approach to their platform:

- **No Public API**: Despite being used by thousands of schools, there's no official, documented API for developers
- **Zero Transparency**: Changes to the backend occur without warning, breaking third-party integrations
- **Artificial Barriers**: Simple data that should be easily accessible is obscured behind proprietary interfaces

This opacity has forced us to rely on reverse-engineered solutions, creating unnecessary technical debt and development delays for what should be a straightforward integration.

## 🚀 Getting Started

## Development

### Prerequisites

- JDK 11
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Maven

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zzacklack/school-dashboard.git
   cd school-dashboard
   ```

2. **Set up the backend**

   ```bash
   cd Backend
   # Update application.properties with your DSBmobile credentials
   mvn clean package
   # Replace X.Y.Z with the current version number
   java -jar target/school-dashboard-backend-X.Y.Z.jar
   ```

3. **Set up the frontend**

   ```bash
   cd ../Frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: <http://localhost:5173>
   - Backend API: <http://localhost:8080>

## Production

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Configuration

1. **Configure the Backend**:

- Set the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable to `prod` in your `docker-compose.yaml` file.
- Ensure all necessary environment variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys) are properly configured for the production environment.

2. **Configure the Frontend**:

- Ensure the frontend is configured to point to the correct backend URL. In the Dockerfile, the `sed` command replaces `http://localhost:8080` with `/api`. This assumes that your Nginx configuration correctly proxies `/api` requests to the backend service.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Build the Docker Images**:

  ```bash
  docker-compose build
  ```

2. **Run the Application with Docker Compose**:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

  This command builds the images and starts the containers in detached mode.

### Verification

1. **Check Container Status**:

  ```bash
  docker-compose ps
  ```

  Verify that both the frontend and backend containers are running without issues.

2. **Access the Application**:

  Open your browser and navigate to the domain or IP address where your application is deployed.

### HTTPS Configuration (Optional)

If you need HTTPS, you can configure Traefik (or another reverse proxy) to handle SSL termination. Here’s an example using Traefik labels in your `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
frontend:
  # ... other configurations ...
  labels:
  - "traefik.enable=true"
  - "traefik.http.routers.school-dashboard-secure.rule=Host(`your-domain.com`)"
  - "traefik.http.routers.school-dashboard-secure.entrypoints=https"
  - "traefik.http.routers.school-dashboard-secure.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
```

Make sure Traefik is properly configured to use Let's Encrypt for SSL certificate generation.

## 📝 Development Status

This project is currently under active development. The core functionality is implemented, but we're working on:

- Design refinements and UI/UX improvements
- Additional feature implementations
- Performance optimizations
- Comprehensive testing

## 💡 Why We Built This

The existing solution for displaying the substitution plan at GGL was:

- Visually outdated and difficult to read
- Limited to showing only substitution information
- Not responsive or adaptable to different screen sizes
- Unable to display other important information for students and staff

Our dashboard solves these problems by providing a modern, readable interface that combines substitution plans with weather, transportation, and other useful information in one unified display.

## 🔄 Development Roadmap

| Phase | Focus | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Core API Integration & Basic UI | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Enhanced UI & Additional Features | 🔄 In Progress |
| 3 | Testing & Performance Optimization | 🔄 In Progress |
| 4 | Deployment & Documentation | 🧩 Partially done |
| 5 | User Feedback & Iteration | 🔜 Planned |
| 6 | Final Review & Launch | 🔜 Planned |
